"""Which headers count as authentication for ``AAK-MCP-001``.

This has now been wrong twice, the same way both times, so the boundary is
pinned as behaviour rather than left to the regex.

* 2026-07-20: the rule recognised only ``Authorization`` / ``Bearer`` /
  ``X-API-Key`` / ``Api-Key``. Two benign-slice servers authenticating with
  ``X-Nefesh-Key`` and ``X-WR-API-Key`` were reported "without authentication".
  #475 added the ``-key`` family.
* 2026-08-24: the slice grew 368 -> 536 and the same class came straight back.
  ``X-Velarion-Agent-Token`` and ``X-SignDocs-Client-Secret`` are credential
  headers too, and #475 had generalised exactly one suffix.

The interesting half of this file is the negatives. A "no authentication"
finding is CRITICAL, so widening the family is not free: every header wrongly
admitted here turns a real unauthenticated server into a silent pass. The
``-id`` and CSRF cases below are the ones that keep that from happening.
