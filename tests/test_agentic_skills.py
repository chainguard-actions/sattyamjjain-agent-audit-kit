"""OWASP Agentic Skills Top 10 (AST10) — the statically decidable subset.

Three rules, not ten. The count is the point: AST10 names ten risks and only some
of them are a static question, so this family ships the ones where a check over a
skill bundle gives a deterministic answer and the README says plainly which seven
it does not cover.

Three categories were already covered before the family existed and are
deliberately not re-implemented — AST01 and the semantic half of AST04 by
``AAK-SKILL-*`` and ``AAK-POISON-*``, AST03 by ``AAK-COMPOSE-003``. The tests
below hold that, because the obvious way to "complete" this family later is to
add rules that report a second time what another rule already found.
