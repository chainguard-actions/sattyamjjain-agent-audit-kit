"""Dispositions for the 2026-08-21 CVE pair.

One new pin and one that needed no code at all, which is the more interesting
half: `AAK-MCP-CKAN-CVE-2026-73846-001` has carried a floor of 0.4.112 since
2026-08-15, and CVE-2026-53509 is fixed in 0.4.106, so every affected version
already fires. Adding a second CKAN pin would report one dependency twice, which
is the trap that rule was created to avoid when it absorbed three CVEs at once.

The property worth guarding is that the free coverage stays free: if the CKAN
floor is ever lowered below 0.4.106, the claim in the ledger silently stops being
true, and nothing else in the tree would notice.
